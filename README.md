## 📘 Book Data Structure

Each book in the system stores rich and detailed information, similar to what you'd expect in a real-world library database:

- ✍️ Writer – Author of the book
- 📚 Copies – Total copies owned
- ✅ Available – Number of available (not borrowed) copies
- 📝 Summary – Optional summary of the book's content
- 💰 Price/day – Daily borrowing cost
- 🔄 Borrowed for – Tracks how long the book is borrowed
- 📌 Condition – Current condition (e.g., "Available", "Borrowed", etc.)

These details allow the system to simulate a real library workflow with accuracy and flexibility.
